The MAD x86 ASM Program 

MAD magazine No. 258 from October 1985 prominently features The MAD Computer Program, a BASIC program that outputs the MAD logo, Alfred E. Neuman’s face, and his iconic motto, “What, me worry?”. The magazine lists code in BASIC dialects for the Apple II series, the Atari 8-bit family, the Commodore 64/128, and DOS IBM PCs.   

This article presents a port of the PC version to x86 assembly language. It pits one against the other, comparing rendering times and disk space consumption. 

This repository [link] contains the sources and compiled binary. Here are direct links to the BASIC [link] and ASM [link] programs.   

The MAD Computer Program switches to SCREEN 1, medium resolution Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) mode (320x200 pixels, 4 colors). That mode supports two preset color palettes with dark or light intensities. But the background (color 0) can be set to any of sixteen colors. The program asserts COLOR 7,0 to select the dark green-red-brown palette and a gray background. 

The program produces the logo and face by drawing 522 thick, red (color 2) line segments whose endpoint coordinates are pulled from DATA statements comprising most of the code. It creates thick lines by drawing a pair of parallel lines, where the second is horizontally offset by one pixel.   

After drawing the logo and face, the program prints the motto beneath them. Then it waits for a keypress. Afterwards, it switches to SCREEN 0 and WITDH 80, indicating 80x25 text mode. There it prints the copyright message. It waits for a second keypress. Finally, it terminates.
